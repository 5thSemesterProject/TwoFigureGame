To set up a cutscene using Unity's Timeline and Playable Director, follow these steps:

Use the Playable Director and Timeline:
Utilize the Playable Director component in Unity and open the Timeline window to create a cutscene. You can find more information in the official Unity tutorial.

CutScene Trigger Component:
When using the CutScene Trigger Component, ensure to add a rig for he transform reference and the character prefab. This is crucial for proper scene setup and interaction.

Initial Character Position:
Always ensure that the character's position on the first frame of your animation matches its position relative to the director without the timeline animating it. This avoids unexpected movements at the start of the cutscene.

Parent Objects for Transformations:
When using character animations, use the prefabs below the parent objects (e.g., Male Parent and Female Parent). If you plan to apply rotations or translations to your character, perform these actions on the parent objects.

Frame for Camera Deactivation:
Include at least one frame at the end of your animation where the camera can be deactivated. This ensures that the camera state is controlled appropriately during the cutscene.
